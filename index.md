#notice: Mendip Storytelling Circle  meeting Thursday 2nd April at Chewton Mendip Village Hall
---

Mendip Storytelling Circle is an open club run by four people: Colin, Martin, Janet and Terence (hereafter referred to as the Quartet). We have been holding monthly meetings September to June on Thursday evenings since 2013.

Our aim is to share the joy of orally telling stories from memory in the form of narratives, poems and ballads. Although we would also welcome other forms of communication such as Mime, Puppetry and Sign language.

We normally meet on the first Thursday of the month from September to June.

Our meetings take place from 19:30 hours to 22:00 hours, stories start at 20:00 hours.

Currently we meet at Chewton Mendip Village Hall just off the A39 and on the B3114 in the centre of the village and just round the corner from the Waldegrave Arms (BA3 4LL)

One of our Quartet always plays "host" or "master of ceremony's" and another tells the first story, but after that stories can come from anyone.  

If you want to tell a story, speak to the host at the beginning of the meeting.  We recommend that stories last no longer than about 10 minutes unless specially arranged with one of the Quartet before the evening.

Before stories begin at 8.00 pm and during the intermission tea and coffee and biscuits are made available by our "catering gang" of Carol and another Janet.

We don't charge for admission to our evening Circle, nor for the refreshments. However we do invite anyone who attends and enjoys the evening to drop a contribution "in the hat" to help with the cost of hall hire, heating and advertising.
