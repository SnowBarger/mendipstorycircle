Martin has always had an interest in the folk world as a singer, morrisman, dance caller and drummer with a ceilidh band, he loves folk tradition and performed in many Mummers Plays always playing the role of Father Christmas as did his Great-grandfather who was also a step-dancer and accompanied himself on a piccolo.

Martin has revived the tradition of Wassail and Burning the Ashen Faggot in Kilmersdon.

Storytelling is a natural extension of folk tradition which Martin has performed for some years now, he is known as The Somerset Storyteller and all his stories are Somerset themed. Martin provides storytelling evenings for W.I. groups, clubs and societies all over the South West.
