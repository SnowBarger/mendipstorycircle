        <h1>Storytelling.</h1>
        
        <p>Storytelling is simple. We all do it all the time without realising. When we recount an odd activity or event that happened yesterday to our friends at the pub.</p>

<p>When people come, they often think, they could never tell a story themselves. Some have a go quickly, and others wait a few months, but all are welcome to have a go when ready.</p>

<p>Most of the stories we tell are traditional, but some of us recite poems and sing ballads, and others tell stories that happened to them just the other day or even stories we made up.</p>

<p>We aim to make our circle a welcoming place to everyone, whether new to storytelling or an old hat. To help with this we have three rules.</p>

<ol>
  <li>No Reading.  <br />
 All stories must be told from memory or made up on the spot.</li>
  <li>10 Minutes tops.  <br />
 Be kind to other tellers and listeners.</li>
  <li>Listen.
 Be kind to the tellers who have put in the work preparing the stories. Show your appreciation at the end too, as this helps people to have another go.</li>
</ol>
