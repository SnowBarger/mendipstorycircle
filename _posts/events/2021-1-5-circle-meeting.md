title: Circle meeting

Circle Meeting 5th January, was especially rewarding with some brilliant storytelling: First on was Martin with a "shaggy dog" tale about being stuck in the mud during WW1.  Next came Lesley with a shopkeeping twist on reducing anger in our communications.  Third up was Jem with an Anancy story involving bean stew!  Then came Hazel with an exhausting one woman/four characters pantomime about George and the Dragon.  

This was followed by Lisa and an unusual story about the creation of day, night and time.  Colin came next with a jocular tale of the Devils Portion.  Janet followed this with another, what I took to be, African Story involving a child with foresight and the great Marimba.  Then Sharon telling a physically demanding Trickster story involving a demon. First time storytelling then came from Anne, who called on her experience of living for a time in Egypt to tell a GOHA story (we sometimes know these under another middle eastern characters name Mullah Nasruddin).  Terence then followed this with a story for Epiphany, a last chance to reflect on Christmas, with the legend of Babushka who is late following the Magi. Then the evening was rounded off with George singing a very funny and fishy variation on the Hippopotamus song "Squid,Squid".
