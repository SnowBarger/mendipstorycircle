title: Circle Meeting
---

Regular monthly meeting of the Circle at Chewton Mendip Village Hall BA3 4LL.            

As promised, this meeting of the circle was a "cracker" with real Christmas crackers and chocolate money! Janet got us off to a great start with the story of Van Amsterdam and the origin of the Bakers Dozen. Jem then came on with a story about Father Christmas's donkey.

Hazel followed with not one, but three of her self penned verses:
1. A Mouse at Christmas
2. A poignant verse about a Soldier
3. The Christmas Fairy's Lament.

Martin did his "very short story", I think a total of nine words long. Mike did the first of several jokes. Terence told the English traditional "fairy story" The Rose Tree. Sharon did a physically demanding story about a King who wanted a champion grasshopper. Colin told a version of "The Cracked Pot" Matt a Chinese set story about redistributive justice and a Shed! Jem did another story about a "Silvery Gift" from that prolific storyteller Duncan Williamson. And finally George finished the evening off by reciting a poem by Robert Service "The Cremation of Sam McGee".
