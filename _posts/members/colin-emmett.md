Colin was first introduced to storytelling whilst listening, with his grandmother, to David Kossoff telling Bible stories on the wireless. Later, having discovered the world of folk traditions, Colin enjoyed telling the odd tale himself.

Now, in retirement, Colin tell stories at every opportunity and is active in promoting the oral tradition of storytelling at open garden events, flower festivals, U3A, village socials, WI's, weddings, care homes and Storytelling gatherings.

Having spent 40 years producing large wooden toys for a living Colin still strives to make wooden jig dolls for a hobby. Colin is also heavily involved in organising [Priston Festival]( http://www.priston.org.uk/festival ) and promoting live music sessions in pubs.
