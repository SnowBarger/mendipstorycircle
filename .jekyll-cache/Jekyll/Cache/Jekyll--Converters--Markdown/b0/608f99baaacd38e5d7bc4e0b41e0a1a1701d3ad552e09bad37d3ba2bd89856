      <p>Janet North has a passion for sharing stories.  As a child she loved to write, but it was not until 2012, when she discovered a course called â€˜Begin It Nowâ€™, that she found others who understood the voice of imagination.</p>

<p>It was a life changing event and that led her to undertake full time training to become a storyteller.</p>

<p>In 2014 she graduated from the International School of Storytelling and since has been telling stories at every opportunity:  Working with children and arts organisation; Telling tales to the elderly in care homes; Memory Cafes, WIs, and much more.</p>
