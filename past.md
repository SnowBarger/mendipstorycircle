Circle Meeting 5th January, was especially rewarding with some brilliant storytelling: First on was Martin with a "shaggy dog" tale about being stuck in the mud during WW1.  Next came Lesley with a shopkeeping twist on reducing anger in our communications.  Third up was Jem with an Anancy story involving bean stew!  Then came Hazel with an exhausting one woman/four characters pantomime about George and the Dragon.  This was followed by Lisa and an unusual story about the creation of day, night and time.  Colin came next with a jocular tale of the Devils Portion.  Janet followed this with another, what I took to be, African Story involving a child with foresight and the great Marimba.  Then Sharon telling a physically demanding Trickster story involving a demon. First time storytelling then came from Anne, who called on her experience of living for a time in Egypt to tell a GOHA story (we sometimes know these under another middle eastern characters name Mullah Nasruddin).  Terence then followed this with a story for Epiphany, a last chance to reflect on Christmas, with the legend of Babushka who is late following the Magi. Then the evening was rounded off with George singing a very funny and fishy variation on the Hippopotamus song "Squid,Squid".

Debs Newbold is returning to the Victoria Hall Radstock on Sunday 29th January 7,30pm in her new one-woman version of Shakespeare's "MACBETH". This is a must-see show for all lovers of theatre and story. Those of you who have seen her two previous shows in Radstock: Romeo & Juliet, and King Lear will know what a brilliant, dynamic performer Debs is and how she can make those familiar stories of Shakespeare breath with fresh life. For anyone who doubts that Shakespeare can be either entertaining or even understandable, come and see Debs and prepare to be astonished. 



Thursday 8th December> Regular monthly meeting of the Circle at Chewton Mendip Village Hall BA3 4LL.            As promised, this meeting of the circle was a "cracker" with real Christmas crackers and chocolate money! Janet got us off to a great start with the story of Van Amsterdam and the origin of the Bakers Dozen. Jem then came on with a story about Father Christmas's donkey. Hazel followed with not one, but three of her self penned verses: 1) a Mouse at Christmas 2) A poignant verse about a Soldier and 3) The Christmas Fairy's Lament. Martin did his "very short story", I think a total of nine words long. Mike did the first of several jokes. Terence told the English traditional "fairy story" The Rose Tree. Sharon did a physically demanding story about a King who wanted a champion grasshopper. Colin told a version of "The Cracked Pot" Matt a Chinese set story about redistributive justice and a Shed! Jem did another story about a "Silvery Gift" from that prolific storyteller Duncan Williamson. And finally George finished the evening off by reciting a poem by Robert Service "The Cremation of Sam McGee".
